(Official rules call for 6 inches max). <LI>Shoes hitting the grass or wood (logs) are 'dead' - and do not count (if they should rebound or roll into scoring position)!  <LI>Shoes must land in the sand! <LI>The closest shoe to the stake gets 1 point.<LI>If you have two shoes closer than any of your opponent's, you get 2 points. <LI>Ringers are worth 3 points each and must completely encircle the stake so the ends can be touched with a straight-edge without touching the stake. <LI>If you have the closest shoe and a ringer, it's 4 points. <LI>If your opponent throws a ringer on top of yours, they cancel and no points are scored. <LI>Leaners are worth 1 point and are considered closer than any adjacent shoe except ringers. (Official rules give no value to leaners!!!). <LI>Beer Drinking and barbecue will continue <LI>See Chin, Sully, Doc, or Charlie if you have any questions  <LI>Good Luck    </OL> <HR>This is the last event!
