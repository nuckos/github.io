		<td> A Perfect Bullet Rye Manhattan with standard ingredients. Serving this drink in a standard chilled martini glass enhanced the drink and added to the ambiance of the modern bar with its wall of liquor that can be seen in the web page photos. A welcome respite for a weary traveller.

		<td> Jim Watson </td>
		<td> A Classic Manhattan (not perfect) made with Michter's Rye Whiskey and Carpano Antica Vermouth. Served in a Nick and Nora glass it was the perfect match to appetizers in the upscale restaurant. It was so delicious that I may have consumed two. Garnished with 3 high quality infused cherries.

		<td> Manhattan After Dark </td> 
		<td> $19.00  </td>
		<td> Jim Watson </td>
		<td> A specialty cocktail weirdly titled "Manhattan After Dark," from a high-end establishment only serving breakfast and lunch. Hence the exorbitant price and small portion. Made with Fig-infused rye, pine liquor, Japanese red wine, molasses bitters and amaro. The libation was served in a coupe glass and garnished with a small fig. Not your standard ingredients, but the taste was amazing. A wonderful start to a long and expensive day of consuming both beverage and food. While the ingredients were very exotic, the portion was nowhere near the generous pour received at the House of Bachi located in Normandy Bach, NJ.

The very precise bartender served a petite Manhattan, expertly stirred with Island Bitters, and garnished with a cherry and elegant orange twist.  The steep price was on par with South Pacific libations served in remote, idyllic corners of the world. USD cost is about $27

		<td> This custom drink is made with a unique single barrel bourbon only available at Redstone, which is why I decided to order one on a Monday night during a work meeting. 
			My coworkers may have been surprised by my drink choice but no matter. The drink itself was full bodied, smooth and rich. The cocktail was perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness 
			from the vermouth and spice from the bitters with subtle cherry flavors peaking through. This Manhattan was more than just a drink, it was an experience. 
			The first sip of the Woodford Reserve bourbon sent a surge of euphoria through my body, making me feel relaxed and happy. It was a heavenly drink that made me forget all my worries. Would order again. </td>
