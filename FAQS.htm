<tr><td> <strong> Question: </strong> How the hell is weightlifting a sport but Golf isn't? </td> </tr> 
<tr><td> <strong> Answer: </strong> Great question.  </td> </tr> 

<tr><td> Weightlifting is a sport because, when in competition, the participant using his/her physical abilities to lift the most weight is the winner.   
Key determinants are 1) physical abilities and 2) measured amount of weight.  Weightlifting as a workout without competition is not a sport.   </td> </tr> 
<tr><td>   </td> </tr> 

<tr><td> Golf, like bowling, horseshoes, darts, shuffleboard, is a leisurely activity that requires limited physical activity.    
Although great skill is required to be a top golfer, the lack of using human powered physical actions (running, throwing, jumping, catching, hitting a moving ball, etc.) excludes golf from the sport category.   
 Make golf a race, then it would be a sport.          </td> </tr>

<h2 align="left">Is Cheerleading a Sport? </h2>

<table border="0" cellspacing="5">
<tbody>

<tr><td> <strong> Question: </strong> Hello, I just saw on your little sport thing what is not a sport and what is a sport you said that cheerleading is not a sport let me tell you something cheerleading is definitely a sport you have to work you have practices every day you have to learn choreography you have to compete Its not where you just sit around like chess you actually do work and unlike football sometimes people just sit there and I know that was written in 2008 but yall need to catch up because cheerleading is a sport!
 Thank you  </td> </tr> 
<tr><td>   </td> </tr> 

<tr><td> <strong> Answer: </strong> Thanks for your feedback.  I agree that it takes hard work, practice, teamwork, and athletic ability to put on a great cheerleading routine.  However, cheerleading is <strong> not </strong> a sport!

<tr><td> In fact, anything <q>choreographed</q> is not a sport.  Please take a look at the <q>guidelines</q> to help clarify what is, and what is not a sport.  Anything that relies solely on judges to determine the winner (such as Cheerleading) is not a sport. Relying on judges alone is too subjective to be a true sport.   This was as true in 2008 as it is today! </tr></td> 

<tr><td> By the way, chess is not a sport either.  Please let us know if there are any other sports that require further clarification.  </tr></td>  
<tr><td>  Thanks for your question. </td> </tr> 
<tr><td>   </td> </tr>     
<tr><td>   </td> </tr> 

 
<tr><td> <strong> Follow-up Question: </strong> I agree on a little bit of what you are saying, but some of it is just not right about the choreographing let me ask you this do the football players have to work hard and run drills, and then that case that is pretty much saying that they are choreographed! And the plays that they run are choreographed! </td></tr>  

<tr><td> <strong> Answer: </strong> You raise a valid point regarding the concept of 'choreography.'   In various sports like football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, etc., teams indeed strategize, plan, and rehearse their 'plays,' which can be seen as a form of 'choreography.' However, it's worth noting that the Institute of Sports has been using a more specific definition of choreography, primarily focused on arranging movement sequences for 'dance.'  </td> </tr> 
  

<tr><td> In the realm of sports, the choreography, represented by these plays, often faces disruption from the opposing team's defense. The presence of a defense is a pivotal element in defining a sport. Choreographed events that lack a defense and rely solely on subjective judging for scoring cannot be categorized as sports.  </td> </tr> 


<tr><td> In light of your valuable feedback and input, the Institute of Sports will revise its guidelines to provide a clearer understanding of the role of choreography in determining what constitutes a sport.  </td> </tr> 
          

<tr><td> Thank you again for your feedback and input.    </td> </tr>
