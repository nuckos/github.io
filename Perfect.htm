The drinks were flawless, so we happily ordered a second round to go with the endless spread of fresh Italian food.  Our tough-as-nails waitress somehow made the whole night feel easy and comfortable. In the end, it was a heartfelt evening—sad circumstances, but the perfect way to honor Dan.

A notable service discrepancy occurred when two identical Bulleit Bourbon Perfect Manhattans were ordered simultaneously but priced differently <A HREF="frankies112925.htm"> ($10.25 and $14.25). </A> The two Manhattans were prepared by separate bartenders, which seemed to contribute to the confusion between the bar staff and the server.

For the first time ever, the Manhattan arrived without a garnish; no cherry, no twist. Odd. The drink itself was bland and forgettable, though it matched the equally average surf and turf special. Luckily, the company and conversation carried the night. Price unknown since the bill was graciously taken care of by the out of town guests. Thank you!

Excellent company, lively conversation, and laughs with visiting guests Race (CA) and Brendan (FL).

Did include the famous Crab's Claw "extra" pour.  Initially, disappointed in the drink, but after a couple of sips, the drink pulled itself together.  Great chat with a Millstone couple.
