<b>How can I join the IOPG?  It seems like a pretty good investment club.  What kind of returns are you getting?  Who is the President of the IOPG?    </b><br>

<b>The Why Games changed my life.  My life was in shambles - I was using drugs, fighting with friends and family, thinking evil dark thoughts. My life was a mess.  But then the IOPG contacted me about the Why Games.  They helped me turn my life around.  They gave me advice and guidance and showed me that I could change.  The IOPG is much much more than an investment club; for they are doing God's work on earth.  Thank you IOPG!           </b><br>

<b>I second IOPG brother Chal's comments - The IOPG is as strong and focused as ever. We look forward to meeting all challenges posed by the current socio-political climate and by all those naterring nabobs of negativism , i.e. the liberal media, that seem to exist only to question our resolve. Just because we're way overdue for a meeting does not mean we're disbanding. Good returns and good fun to you all.  </b><br>

<b>Yes Alice, perhaps we could enter our own Rock and Roll team into the Why Games! So long as the IOPG chaps stay with soccer and golf, odds are we would take home the Golden Bearst!  Cheers.  </b><br>

<b>Sorry Lou, the demise of the IOPG is just a nasty rumor.  The IOPG is stonger than ever and continues to focus on our investment goals.  So we will not be joining your investment club.  Good Luck to you! </b><br>

<b>Sure the Why Games are a great event, but I heard that the IOPG is having internal problems and may be breaking up.  If this is true, I want to invite some of you to join my investment club.  Let me know.  </b><br>

<b>Sorry Mike.  At this time we are not selling shirts and hats over the internet.  We will consider doing so in the future.  Stop back periodically to check the site for new features.  Thanks!    </b><br>

<b>The 'velvet rope' is an old IOPG tradition that is used to  segregate the IOPG members from the common people.  On special occasions, honored guests are invited to enter the domain of the 'velvet rope' where they can enjoy the company of the IOPG members.      </b><br>

<b>The shirts were the best.  Do you sell those shirts on the IOPG website?  I want to buy some for my family and friends.  You should also sell hats.    </b><br>

<b>Best Y games to date.  Should have had a tie breaker...
although Chin's first place finish in the "put your 
Head through a wall" event should of secured outright 
first place.  Need to bring back hoops and the obstacle 
course/relay race next year.
